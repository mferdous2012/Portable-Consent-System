You are expected not only to identify the fields but also interpret and explain complex clauses involving multiple parties within different jurisdictions while considering overlapping consent rights and obligations under various laws such as GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, PIPEDA etc.,\n\nFor each clause provided:\n\n1. Determine the Jurisdiction (e.g., EU-specific law like GDPR or broader US regulations like CCPA).\n\n2. Extract and identify Clause Type from a set of [\"Consent Grant\", \"Consent Withdrawal\", \n                        \"Consent Update\", \"Purpose Limitation\", \n\n\"Data Sharing\",\"Access Request\",\"Revocation\"]. In cases where multiple clause types are applicable, list them.\n\n3. Clearly define the Data Subject's Role and the associated consent-related rights (e.g., individual user or patient).\n\n4. Pinpoint the precise Entity acting as the data controller with explicit references to their obligations under each law where relevant. These entities might include \"healthcare provider\", \"social media platform\" etc. Consider both direct mention and implied roles based on contextual clues in your analysis.\n\n5. Extract Rights Mentioned, differentiating between rights unique to the jurisdiction's privacy regulation (e.g., 'Right to Be Forgotten' under GDPR) and those commonly shared across various laws like access to data or purpose limitation. \n\n6. Enumerate Obligations imposed on the Controller, highlighting any specific actions they must undertake in respect of consent requests (e.g., explicit opt-in for certain processing activities).\n\n7. Identify Time Limitations where specified and explain their significance within each jurisdiction's frameworkâ€”if omitted or not mentioned explicitly due to being implied by law, note this as well with appropriate justification using the relevant legal standards of that jurisdiction (e.g., GDPR Article 4(12)).\n\n8. Outline Withdrawal Conditions clearly if they are provided and explain how these conditions reflect both local expectations for consent withdrawability and universal best practices in user autonomy where applicable across different laws. If such details aren't present, discuss the typical standards expected or required by law within that jurisdiction (e.g., ease of revocation processes).\n\n9. Summarize each clause concisely but comprehensively into a 1-line plain English summary highlighting key points and implications for all parties involved. Where necessary due to technical complexity, include parenthetical clarifications or expansions (e.g., \"(explaining the 'Right to be Forgotten' in layman terms)\").\n\nReturn the response as a JSON object with nested arrays where needed:\n\n```json\n\n{\n\n  \"jurisdiction\": \"\",\n\n  \"clause_types\": [], \n\n  ...,\n\n}\n\n```\n\nClauses for analysis (Please assume each clause pertains to a different jurisdiction):\n\n\"\"\"Under HIPAA in the US-based healthcare sector, patients have been informed that their personal data can be used solely for treatment purposes and disclosed only to authorized entities.\"\"\"\n\n...and so on."
